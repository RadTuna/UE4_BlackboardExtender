# Blackboard Extender
Plugins to improve Blackboard in Unreal Engine

## Why Expand?
Blackboard and Behaivior Tree in Unreal Engine are not bad. However, Blackboard Editor is not good. In Blueprint Editor, variables or functions can be arranged by Drag&Drop, and categories can be set. However, that is not possible at all in the Blackboard Editor. Therefore, Blackboard Extender serves as an assistant to actively use Blackboard in developing complex AI by providing sorting and categorizing functions of Blackboard Entry.
